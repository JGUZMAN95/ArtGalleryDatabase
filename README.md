In this project we are trying build an Art Gallery Database Management System similar to what
Artlogic, Art Galleria and Art Cloud have to offer to galleries. The end goal will be to be able to
provide a place for art galleries to showcase art that their gallery is selling and has sold, while
also providing information about the artist, the art piece and its price. This will help art galleries
cliental to expand by informing a collector upfront about the art that the collector is interested in,
while allowing the gallery to be seconds away from a sell.
